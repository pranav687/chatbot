TEST INFORMATION FOR VECTOR DATABASE VERIFICATION

This is a test knowledge base file created specifically to verify that the vector database is working correctly.

Key test facts:
1. The Concordia Multi-Agent Chatbot test knowledge base was created on April 4, 2025.
2. The vector database should retrieve this information when queries contain the word "test" or "verification".
3. This is unique information that would not be generated by the LLM without retrieval from the vector database.

If you see this information in the chatbot's response, it confirms that the vector database is working correctly.

This is a test knowledge base file for testing vector database functionality.

Test Topic 1: Vector Databases
Vector databases are specialized databases designed to store and query vector embeddings. They are commonly used in machine learning applications, particularly for similarity search and recommendation systems. Key features include:
- Efficient similarity search
- Support for high-dimensional vectors
- Scalability for large datasets
- Integration with machine learning frameworks

Test Topic 2: Embeddings
Embeddings are numerical representations of text, images, or other data types in a continuous vector space. They capture semantic meaning and relationships between different pieces of information. Important aspects:
- Dimensionality reduction
- Semantic similarity
- Feature representation
- Machine learning applications

Test Topic 3: Similarity Search
Similarity search is a technique used to find items that are similar to a given query item. Common methods include:
- Cosine similarity
- Euclidean distance
- Dot product
- Manhattan distance

Test Topic 4: ChromaDB
ChromaDB is an open-source embedding database that can be used for storing and querying vector embeddings. Features:
- Simple API
- Persistent storage
- Metadata filtering
- Real-time updates

Test Topic 5: LangChain Integration
LangChain provides tools for working with vector stores and embeddings. Key components:
- Document loaders
- Text splitters
- Embedding models
- Vector store interfaces

This knowledge base is used to test the vector database functionality of the chatbot system.
